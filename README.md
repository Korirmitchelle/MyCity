# MyCity

My city is a sample app to demonstrate consumption of an API.

- Fetch cities
- Filter through search
- View cities on map


## Tech

Mycity uses the following to work properly:

-  [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) - The IDE!
- [Swift 5](https://www.swift.org/blog/swift-5-released/) and [Rxswift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift)
- [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org)  - For dependency management.
- [Realm](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm-legacy/docs/swift/latest/) and [RXRealm](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxRealm) - For local caching(offline mode)
- [Googlemaps](https://cocoapods.org/pods/GoogleMaps) - show cities on the map


## Installation

Clone project and run 'pod install'
